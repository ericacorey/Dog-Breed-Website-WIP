      The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals® (ASPCA®)
      was the first humane society to be established in North America and is,
      today, one of the largest in the world. Our organization was founded on
      the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at
      the hands of humans and must be protected under the law. Headquartered in
      New York City, the ASPCA maintains a strong local presence, and with
      programs that extend our anti-cruelty mission across the country, we are
      recognized as a national animal welfare organization. We are a privately
      funded 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation, and are proud to boast more
      than 2 million supporters across the country. The ASPCA’s mission, as
      stated by founder Henry Bergh in 1866, is “to provide effective means for
      the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States.”
